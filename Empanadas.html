        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Empanadas come in many different forms with many different fillings. This version is a flavor bomb, 
            with tender chicken thighs, peppers, and olives, bolstered by tomato paste and paprika, but feel free
            to go the ground beef route if that's more your jam!
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. sweet paprika</li>
            <li>2 tsp. cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 c. castelvetrano or green olives, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>12 to 16 frozen and thawed empanada wrappers, such as Goya</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 375º. Pat chicken thighs dry with paper towels 
                and season thoroughly on all sides with salt and pepper. Add chicken 
                to a medium-size pot, and add water just to cover the chicken. Add a 
                tablespoon of salt and bay leaves, and bring to a boil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and cook until the chicken is cooked 
                through and registers 165ºF when probed with a thermometer, about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer chicken to a bowl or cutting board to cool. Reserve 1 cup of the cooking
                water and set aside. Shred chicken and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil. Heat until it shimmers, then 
                add onion and bell peppers. Cook until the onion is golden and the peppers have begun 
                to brown on the edges, 6 to 8 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium and stir in
                tomato paste and cook until it has darkened slightly in color, 2 to 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the shredded chicken, paprika, oregano, and cumin. Mix well until fully combined.
                Cook for 4 to 5 minutes or until the chicken is heated through and the spices have toasted slightly.
                Add the olives and mix until combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour in reserved 1 cup cooking liquid and cook, stirring occasionally until a glossy sauce forms on the 
                chicken, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.
            </li>
            <li>
                To shape the empanadas: Roll out a wrapper until it is about ¼” to ½” larger than it was before.
                Scoop 2 to 3 tablespoons of filling onto the center of the wrapper. Brush a bit of beaten egg wash 
                on the edges of the dough, then fold the wrapper so that it resembles a half moon.
            </li>
            <li>
                Press the ends together and crimp by pleating the edges or pressing down with a fork. 
                Repeat until all the filling has been used.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer empanadas to a baking sheet and brush the tops with more egg wash. 
                Bake until the pastry is golden brown, about 20 to 25 minutes. Allow to cool for 
                5 to 10 minutes and serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
