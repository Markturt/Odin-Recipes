        <p>
            Arroz con gandules is a traditional Puerto Rican dish that consists of rice, pork, tomato paste, 
            achiote, gandules (pigeon peas), and sofrito. Perfect served alongside pernil and yuca fries 
            (and followed up by a glass of coquito), arroz con gandules is perfect for holiday gatherings or 
            weeknight dinners.

            <li> 1 small Spanish or yellow onion, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1 small green bell pepper, seeds and ribs removed, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1 small bunch fresh culantro or cilantro</li>
            <li>  6 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. dried oregano</li></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>ARROZ</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp. neutral oil</li>
            <li>4 oz. salt pork or bacon, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 c. double-concentrated tomato paste</li>
            <li>3 c. medium- or long-grain rice, rinsed</li>
            <li>3 c. water</li>
            <li>1 (15-oz.) can pigeon peas (gandules), drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>1/2 c. alcaparrado mix or equal amount of Manzanilla olives, pimento peppers, and/or capers</li>
            <li> 2 tsp. adobo all-purpose seasoning</li>
            <li>1 small packet sazón con achiote (1 1/8 tsp.)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>STEPS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large caldero or Dutch oven over medium heat, heat oil. Add salt pork and cook, stirring occasionally,
                until fat has rendered out and pork is crisp, 3 to 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Carefully stir in sofrito and tomato paste. Cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly reduced and mixture
                 is no longer vibrantly green, about 4 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in rice, water, pigeon peas, alcaparrado mix, adobo seasoning, and sazón con achiote and bring to a boil 
                over medium-high heat. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid reduces to the point that a few 
                rice granules are peeking through the liquid, 3 to 4 minutes. Give everything one more gentle stir, then reduce
                 heat to low and cover. Cook, without uncovering, until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 30 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from heat, place a towel underneath lid, and let rice steam 20 minutes before serving.
            </li>
        </ol>
